WS4D-gSOAP is a toolkit for developing Web services consumer and
provider being conform to the “Devices Profile for Web Services”
(DPWS) in C/C++. The toolkit is implemented as an extension to the
well known gSOAP Web services toolkit. Developers can concentrate on
the implementation of a device's functionality as WS4D-gSOAP supports
code generation on service and device level.

WS4D-gSOAP offers multi-platform support such as Linux i386,
Windows-native, Windows-cygwin and embedded Linux. The toolkit
supports development within a typical GNU software development
toolchain or an integrated development environment such as Visual
